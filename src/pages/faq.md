## What ages do you cater for?
[We have porgrams suitable for 5 to 16 year olds]

## What happens in bad weather?
[For the most part we carry on. If roads are closed we typically cancel, otherwise we try use the weather as an opportunity to do something unique that we wouldn't be able to on a fine day.]

## Is Wildwood a registered school?
[No, Wildwood is a completely independent organisation. It is not registered with NESA and does not deliver formal 'education' outcomes.]

## Do you follow the NSW curriculum?
[No, we design the day's activities around the seasonally available resources and opportunities]

## How do enrolments work?
[If you send us a message we will discuss with you which groups are available and appropriate for your child. From there we can line up an obligation free trial day. If the trial day is a success we then formalise the arrangement, send you an invoice and you are booked in for the term. We operate on a term by term basis.]

## How much does each group cost?
[Our normal Robertson based forest school days cost about $80 a day, averaged over the term. So if it is a ten week term the cost would be $800 to book the spot in the group. There are no refunds for days missed due to illness or unavailability.]

## About $80 a day? What?
[Instead of having a fixed fee for all, we offer a no questions asked sliding scale fee structure. We want Wildwood to be available to all children. So in order to remove any financial barriers, we allow families to pay what they are able. Some families may be able to pay more, some less. On average, it works out.] 

## Any discounts for siblings?
[Yes, each sibling gets a $10 a day discount. Meaning that if a family had 3 kids at Wildwood, The first child would be $800 for the term, second child $700 and the third child would be $600. If a family had 9 children at WIldwood I guess that means the 9th child gets paid to come!]

## Are there casual or flexible attendance options??
[No unfortunately, the committment is for the whole term.] 

## If I homeschool my child, can I use their experiences at Wildwood to document their learning?
[Certainly, many families write up their experiences at Wildwood and keep them as references for their homeschooling journey.]

## My child goes to school, can they come to Wildwood?
[Yes certainly, though we appreciate that taking one day off a week is sometimes challenging to organise. The best way forward is usually a formal partnership with the school. We can write a letter to your school and begin the discussion. Most schools are quite supportive. If your school isn't supportive, give us a call and we can chat through some helpful options.]
