# A Christian, Self-Directed, Nature-Based Learning Community

![Wildwood in action](/images/Wildwood-46.jpg)

**Wildwood Forest School** exists to offer children rich, grounded experiences that cultivate strength of character, internal motivation, and readiness for an uncertain world.

Grounded in the conviction that every child is created with inherent dignity, value, and purpose, we believe education should not be about control, compliance, or standardisation, but about cultivating lives marked by capability, empathy, curiosity, and humility.

Wildwood is not a school in the conventional sense.  
It is a quiet guardian of childhood, before it is hurried or hardened

## Our Philosophy

Wildwood is shaped by three interlocking foundations that inform how we design environments, make decisions, and relate to children.

### **Imago Dei — The Image of God**

We believe each child is created in the image of God.

This belief places inherent worth, agency, and moral significance at the centre of our work. Children are not problems to be managed or vessels to be filled, but persons to be respected, entrusted, and formed. They are capable of real responsibility, meaningful choice, and growth over time.

Because of this, we take children seriously. We speak truthfully, set real boundaries, and offer genuine trust — recognising that formation happens not through coercion, but through relationship, example, and practice.

### **Self-Determination Theory — How Humans Flourish**

Research consistently shows that human beings flourish when three core needs are supported:

- **Autonomy** — meaningful choice and ownership  
- **Competence** — growing real skill and capability  
- **Relatedness** — connection to others, place, and purpose  

Rather than relying on rewards, punishments, or external pressure, we seek to create environments that naturally support these needs. Motivation is not fabricated; it is allowed to arise.

### **Flow — Deep Engagement and Meaningful Work**

Deep learning emerges when children are fully engaged in meaningful activity — when challenge and skill are well matched, attention is focused, and motivation comes from within.

We prioritise conditions that allow this kind of engagement to arise naturally: time, freedom, real work, and environments that invite effort, risk, and responsibility.

## Our Approach to Learning

Wildwood does not follow a fixed curriculum or predetermined timetable. Instead, learning is shaped by what is *alive and present* in each day.

We design the rhythm of our days in response to real conditions: the weather of the morning, the season of the year, the energy of the children, and the resources at hand. Learning is not abstracted from life and then delivered; it arises from attention to what is available **here and now**.

Our programs are **unstructured but supported**. Children are free to choose how they engage, while adults remain present, attentive, and responsive -- offering guidance, boundaries, and care where needed, without directing or controlling outcomes.

This means the work changes with the seasons.

When apples are ripe, we pick mountains of them. We press juice, bake cakes, and play *fruit ninja* with the mushy ones. When mushrooms appear, we drop what we were doing and head into the forest to harvest enough for the year. When rain arrives, plans shift. When energy runs low, the pace softens. When curiosity ignites, time stretches.

We never allow an old agenda to override what is available to enjoy, learn from, and take responsibility for in the present moment.

We place particular emphasis on:

- **Time** -- unhurried, uninterrupted space for deep engagement  
- **Place** -- natural environments that invite exploration, responsibility, and stewardship  
- **Attention** -- adults who notice what is emerging and respond with care  
- **Reality** -- real work, real consequences, and real satisfaction  

Learning at Wildwood is inseparable from life. Children learn through doing -- through trial and error, observation, conversation, and responsibility. Growth is not rushed or engineered.

## Faith and Culture

Wildwood operates explicitly within a Christian worldview.

All staff are Christians, and we understand our work at Wildwood as a form of ministry. Our role is not merely to supervise or facilitate activities, but to care for children with seriousness, humility, and love.

The Bible is opened and read at all Wildwood programs.

We do not compel belief, but we are clear and honest about the foundations that shape our work. Families who join Wildwood understand that our culture, language, and values are shaped by Christian convictions about human dignity, work, responsibility, forgiveness, and hope.

## Who Wildwood Is For

Wildwood is for families seeking something different from conventional, compliance-driven education.

It is suited to those who value:

- environments that respect children as moral agents  
- learning that is embodied, relational, and meaningful  
- freedom paired with responsibility  
- a Christian cultural foundation  
- preparation for a world that cannot be fully predicted or standardised  

Wildwood is intentionally small, relational, and grounded. We are not trying to be everything for everyone.

## A Final Word

Childhood is brief.  
The days are long, but the years are short.

At Wildwood, we seek to honour this fleeting season — to give children time, space, and care to grow into themselves; to experience joy, wonder, and meaningful work; and to be known, respected, and cherished.
