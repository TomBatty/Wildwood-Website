Wildwood Forest School is grounded in self-directed learning, time outdoors, and respect for children as capable people.

We value:
- Autonomy and intrinsic motivation  
- Mixed-age community  
- Meaningful work and real responsibility  
- Deep play, risk, and time in nature  

Learning emerges through curiosity, relationships, and lived experience rather than imposed curriculum.
