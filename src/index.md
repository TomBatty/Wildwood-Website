## What We Believe

Wildwood Forest School is a Christian, nature-based learning community based in misty rainforests of **Robertson, in the Southern Highlands of NSW**

We believe children learn best through real experiences, meaningful work, and time spent outdoors. Through our simple and earthy programs we aim to create an environment of trust, responsibility, and care, where children are free to grow at their own pace.

## What We Offer

Our programs are **self-directed and supported**, shaped by the seasons, the weather, and the energy of the children.

From forest days in the Highlands to ocean adventures on the coast and hands-on projects in the workshop, learning grows out of what is available each day. Staff are present and attentive, offering guidance and boundaries while leaving space for curiosity, competence, and connection.
